                        <p>Dropped into a true greenfield environment, tasked with building the finance backbone for a new market entry. I oversaw design, financial planning, and alignment with PMI global standards, plus ensuring the right support from the Cape Town hub and access to HQ expertise.</p>

                        <p>Amid a high-stakes product category launch, I redesigned and implemented within 2 months the budgeting framework for an annual commercial budget of $1.5mio — shifting from static, top-down planning to a dynamic, cross-functional approach driven by the needs and ownership of local commercial teams.</p>
                        <p class="result"><strong>&rarr; The result:</strong> <em>Faster decisions, clearer accountability, and full alignment between finance and the market — turning budgeting into a business enabler, not a bottleneck.</em></p>

                        <p>Led the end-to-end design and implementation of Odoo ERP. I taught myself the platform, built the accounting framework, integrated banking systems, and partnered with the COO to deliver non-finance modules.</p>
                        <p>Within 6 months, Accounting and HR modules were configured and deployment-ready, while Sales, Purchasing, and Inventory were fully designed. During project close, I ensured full integration across all modules and supported the final go-live across 17 global entities.</p>

                        <p class="meta"><em>Switzerland</em> | <em>2022–2023</em> | <em>ELDICO Scientific</em></p>
                        <p>Faced with rising financial pressure, I restructured the company into two legal entities — a service arm and an R&D unit — strategically reframing the financial narrative to highlight the strength of the services business. This enabled me to secure a bank loan equivalent to 20% of the company's equity, completed within just four weeks of negotiation.</p>
                        <p>The funding provided six months of runway, safeguarded payroll for a 10-person team, and allowed the company to pay critical operational invoices. The board welcomed the solution.</p>
                        <p class="result"><strong>&rarr; The result:</strong> <em>A bold move, a clear message, and the liquidity needed to fuel what came next.</em></p>
